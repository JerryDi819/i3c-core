# Pyenv

Pyenv is recommended to create and manage Python virtual environment for running tests. The `patch_bashrc.f` file is used by the [install.sh](../../install.sh) script to modify user's bashrc file. If you want to setup pyenv on your own, refer to [pyenv's README](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv).
